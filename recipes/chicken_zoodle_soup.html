    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>With the winter months approaching fast my niece and I co-conspired to come up with this warm and comforting soup using 'zoodles' that's easy on the waistline.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 teaspoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 cup diced onions</li>
        <li>And Many more.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps to prepare</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Saute onion, celery, and garlic in hot oil until just tender, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Pour chicken broth into the pot; add carrots, chicken, basil, oregano, thyme, salt, and pepper. Bring the broth to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer mixture until the vegetables are tender, about 20 minutes.

        </li>
        <li>Divide zucchini 'noodles' between six soup bowls; ladle broth mixture over the 'noodles.'</li>
