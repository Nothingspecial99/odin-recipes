        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Pesto pasta is easy to make and full of flavor. It tastes good hot or cold!</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (16 ounce) package pasta</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>And many more</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Stir in pasta and return to a boil. Cook pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 to 10 minutes. Drain and transfer into a large bowl.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, heat oil in a frying pan over medium-low heat. Add onion; cook and stir until softened, about 3 minutes. Stir in pesto, salt, and pepper until warmed through.</li>
            <li>Add pesto mixture to hot pasta; stir in grated cheese and toss well to coat.</li>
